  <h1>Biography: Elsa Elkaim</h1>

  <p id="semi">My name is Elsa Elkaim and I am 24 years old. Originally from Nice, I pursued finance studies in Milan for my bachelor's degree, before completing my master's degree in Paris and Madrid. My academic career was enriched by an internship in an investment fund in the Middle East, which allowed me to gain valuable experience in the financial field. Passionate about animals and travel, I am currently on exchange in Buenos Aires for a semester, an opportunity that allows me to discover a new culture while continuing to develop my professional skills</p>
