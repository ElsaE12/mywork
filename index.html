<h1> A french student in Buenos Aires</h1>

<h2>Why I decided to spend my semester in Argentina</h2>

<h4>By Elsa Elkaim</h4>

<p>I am a French student who grew up in Nice, on the French riviera. Thanks to my studies I had the chance to live in several cities in Europe and even in the Middle East. Each destination has enriched my vision of the world, but Buenos Aires represents a big step forward for me. It is the furthest I decided to go. This is a vibrant city, rich in history and culture, and I am excited to be able to immerse myself in this dynamic environment. </p>

<p>There are many destinations I could have chosen. But why Buenos Aires : </p>
